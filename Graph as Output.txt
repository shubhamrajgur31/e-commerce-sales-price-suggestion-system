Matplotlib Graph 
This shows Actual vs Predicted Price for each product:

Y-axis → Price (RS)  
X-axis → Product Index  

• Blue Line (circle marker) = Actual Price  
• Orange Line (cross marker) = Predicted Price
It looks something like this (on your screen when you run the code):

Graph Example
A smooth upward line for Actual Prices.
Another line for Predicted Prices closely following it.
The closer they are, the better the model accuracy.
