An intelligent pricing recommendation model that blends sales data, reviews, and current price to optimize profits for Amazon sellers.
# AI-powered Product Recommendation System

## Overview
This project predicts **optimal product prices** for Amazon sellers using **machine learning**.  
The model considers:
-  Units Sold  
-  Customer Reviews  
-  Current Price  

and recommends the **best price** to help maximize sales and revenue.


## Features
-  Linear Regression (baseline ML model)  
-  Random Forest Regressor (advanced model for higher accuracy)  
-  Evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** & **RÂ² Score**  
-  Graph of **Actual vs Predicted Prices** using Matplotlib  
-  ASCII graph output (console-friendly)  
-  Self-contained: dataset is **created inside the script** (no external files needed)  


## Tech Stack
- Python   
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (for ML models & evaluation)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
